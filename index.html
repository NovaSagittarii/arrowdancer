    <h4>NOTE: most bugs should be fixed now; may miss solutions starting with fast tech though</h4>
    <p>
      This tool will find a dance sequence given the steps you give it. (Note: this <em>is intended to</em> support divide&conquer skill). <br>
      Steps are in order of left to right, empty steps are ignored. <br>
      Click a corner/edge box of the square to set its state. <br>
      Scroll to bottom and click solve when you are done.<br>
      Numbers at the bottom indicate how many attacks are done during that state.<br>
      Letters at the bottom (with those numbers) are entry points into the cycle.<br>
